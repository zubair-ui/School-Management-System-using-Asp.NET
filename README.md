# School-Management-System-using-Asp.NET
A simple School Management System using ASP.NET and SQL server

**IMPORTANT**
**you first need to run the query to create the database before executing the code, and you will have to change the data source in all the C# files to what the name of your data source is at your PC**

This is a basic Asp.NET web Application which uses the ASP.NET Framework to build the application with server side controls.
It uses SQL server as a Database , mostly because both are made by microsoft so there integration is much easier and faster. Both connected and disconnected approach has been used to connect, fetch , update, delete the database

Bootstrap has been used for simple styling and navbar for easier access to other web pages of the application
